# ProTech

## Description

This project aims to train a GAN in order to produce images which can be exploited for scientific purposes


## Execute a training

- The code in this repo only aims to train and track the training of GANs, not saving the model for further use
- The code will require you to install a few python libraries with the library manager of your choice
- If you want to obtain results, it is advised to use gan_wasserstein.py as it is the only working example we have
- The first time you try to run the code, just carefully configure the directories
- The gan_wasserstein.py code should run without issues on CPU or GPU (cuda)
